      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Ralph and Maria met at the local church group. At the time, she was active in the youth group with Ralph's brothers and Maria would always be around the house hanging out with them.</p>
      <p>Ralph then joined the young adult group called Singles for Christ and she transitioned as well. It was hard to miss Maria's loud personality and her loud hairstyle. Her infectious spirit, singing talent, hearty laugh, and best of all her beautiful smile was easily drawing Ralph's interest and his heart.</p>
      <p>They started talking and I would like to thank Stephanie Meyer, the author of “Twilight”. It was because of that book series that we got to spend a lot of time talking in the phone. I decided to court her and started by asking her parents for their permission. One year later we became boyfriend and girlfriend after waiting for her to graduate which was one of her parents condition. 9 years later, after going through ups and downs in our relationship we are going strong and FINALLY getting married. We will be getting married on our 10 year anniversary and I couldn’t think of a better date to do it. Honestly, we are truly blessed! We have the loving support of our family, friends, and each other! I can’t wait to get married! We are so ready to move on the next phase of our relationship! We can’t wait for you guys to witness and celebrate our love! Hope to see you soon!</p>
